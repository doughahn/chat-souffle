# Chat Souffl√©

This is a Twine project that integrates xAPI. It requires [Tweego](https://github.com/tmedwards/tweego) and uses [Snowman 2](https://videlais.github.io/snowman/#/) as it makes decent use of custom code rather than Twee shortcodes. 

## Tweego

### Requirements

You'll need [NodeJS](docs/installing-node.md) and [Tweego](docs/installing-tweego.md).  We used the [Tweego boilerplate](https://github.com/ChapelR/tweego-setup) to start this project. Please refer to his readme for full documentaiton about getting going with Tweego. 

### Installation

Clone or download this repo.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory (where the `package.json` file is) and run the command `npm install`.

### Structure

`dist` is where the project `index.html` file compiles to. Note that this github repo also has a `index.html` in the root; GitHub pages deploys from that file, and it can be manually copied from the `dist` folder to there and pushed when ready to deploy. Not ideal but it works for now.\

The `project` folder contains passages

The `src` contains the JavaScript and CSS. There are several JS files in there, they need to be added and loaded in order!

### CLI

There are more commands in the original docs. These are the ones I find useful. 
* `npm run build`: Compiles everything with Tweego and drops the compiled `index.html` file in the `dist` folder.
* `npm run build:test`: As `npm run build`, but compiles your story in test mode.

## xAPI Integration

You can add raw code to passages in Snowman with the `<% your_code_here %>` shortcode. We have two external libraries: the [ADL xAPI 1-11 wrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper) hosted on a teammate's digital ocean server, and [crypto.js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js), which is a dependency of the ADL wrapper itself. 

All the xAPI statements are located in `src/scripts/js/xapi-statements.`

### Verbs

Out project's verb list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qf47gYZWVAjUKNVpsd0DShU309cwUStDkfxgojpdWrY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Deploying Changes to Github Pages

I just put the `index.html` file in the root directory. I can't seem to get thins building quite right with go & twee, and I can;t seem to get Github to respect the `/dist` directory. Copying it from there fine for now.
