# Information collected and disclaimer

Our team needs to collect a minimum amount of information about you and your interactions with this course in order to share back with the xAPI cohort. We want to be transparent with you about what we’re collecting: 

- Each click (e.g. “Next” buttons)
- Survey responses (in the next few slides)

Disclaimer(s) around ChatGPT: Please note that ChatGPT is a language model designed to simulate human-like conversations, but it may not always provide accurate or appropriate responses. It should not be used as a primary source of information in any educational setting and should be used with caution.
