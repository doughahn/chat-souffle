<h2>Welcome!</h2>

Welcome to this course on using ChatGPT to generate and improve multiple choice assessments. 

This is geared for instructional designers who already have basic skills in assessment development. (Don’t worry if you don’t have experience with writing assessments – you’ll still be able to learn about it.)

In this course, you’ll get the opportunity to practice:

* Using ChatGPT as a tool to generate multiple choice assessments
* Applying prompt engineering techniques to iterate on developing multiple choice assessments
* Evaluating the quality of distractors in MC assessments generated by AI
